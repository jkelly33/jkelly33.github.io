	   <aside>  My name is Justin Kelly and I'm in my fourth year at CSM. I had a difficult time 
	    finding out which major I wanted to do; so I took many classes in hopes to find a subject 
		I will be passionate about and would want to do for a profession. Through all the classes
		I took, I found computer science courses to the most interesting and exciting courses. I 
		enjoy the challenge of the field and found there is so much to do and learn in this space
		of Computer Science. I am very excited for this course and learning about web development.
		This will also be my last semester at CSM, as I will be transferring to a four-year 
		university this fall.
	   </aside>
      <footer>  I am taking this class because I like programming and believe skills in web development
       would be very useful. I have seen this course the last couple semesters but never found the time 
	   in my schedule to take the course. However, this semester, I only had a few classes to take
	   so I had some room to take this course.
